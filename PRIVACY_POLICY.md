## 3. Data Storage

### 3.1 Local Storage Only

All data collected by the Extension is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's `storage` API. Specifically:

- Data is stored in your browser's local storage
- Data never leaves your device except when:
  - Sending messages to configured API endpoints
  - Exporting conversations to local files
  - Importing configuration files from your device

### 3.2 No Cloud Servers

The Extension does **not** use any cloud storage, databases, or external servers owned by the developer. All data remains on your device.

### 3.3 API Communication

When you send a message:

1. The Extension forwards your message to the API endpoint you configured (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
2. The API key you provided is used for authentication
3. The response is stored locally in your browser

The Extension does **not** proxy, intercept, or record these communications beyond local storage.

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.

- The Extension has no control over how these third-party services handle your data

**You are responsible for reviewing the privacy policies of any AI services you choose to use.**
